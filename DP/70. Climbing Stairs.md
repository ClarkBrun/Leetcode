# This task requires us to identify that there is a rule behind it. That is the number of steps to reach the upstair f（n）= f (n-1) + f (n-2).
# This function is also called as Fibonacci function
## But I encounter a problem is that timing run out. I think it is due to Recursion and it needs more time to complete this task.
## The code is listed below
```python
class Solution(object):
    def climbStairs(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """        

        if n == 1:
            return 1
    
        elif n == 2:
            return 2

        else:
            ways = self.climbStairs(n - 1) + self.climbStairs(n - 2)
            return ways

```
## I have tried several ways and I think this code works if there is no time limitation.

# I also use Queue to solve this task
## The code is listed below
```python
class Solution(object):
    def climbStairs(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """        
        stair_number = []
        stair_number.append(1)
        stair_number.append(2)

        if n == 1:
            return 1
        elif n == 2:
            return 2
        else:
            for i in range(3, n + 1):
                stair_number.append(stair_number[-1] + stair_number[-2])
                stair_number.pop(0)
            return stair_number[-1]
```
## But this method use more time and consume more memory. So I need a better solution.
