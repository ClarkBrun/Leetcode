# I use two FOR LOOP to complete this task
# There are several things needed to be remembered
## the first one: in python, the form of DICT is "DICT = {'a': ['1', '2', '3'], 'b': ['4', '5', '6']}". It should be Colon but not Equal sign.
## the second one: "output = []" is important, because I need to refresh output so as to avoid that the output become a list likes 
```
["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf","adg","adh","adi","aeg","aeh","aei","afg","afh","afi","bdg","bdh","bdi","beg","beh","bei","bfg","bfh","bfi","cdg","cdh","cdi","ceg","ceh","cei","cfg","cfh","cfi"]

```
```python
  strings.pop(0)
  strings[0] = output
  output = []
```
# I think that I can also use Recursion to complete this task more efficiently and use less memory.

# using RECURSION to complete this task. BUT using this mothod will increase running-time and also memory slightly.
```python
class Solution(object):
    def letterCombinations(self, digits):
        """
        :type digits: str
        :rtype: List[str]
        """
        digitsdict = {
            '2' : ['a', 'b', 'c'],
            '3' : ['d', 'e', 'f'],
            '4' : ['g', 'h', 'i'],
            '5' : ['j', 'k', 'l'],
            '6' : ['m', 'n', 'o'],
            '7' : ['p', 'q', 'r', 's'],
            '8' : ['t', 'u', 'v'],
            '9' : ['w', 'x', 'y', 'z']
        }
        
        result = []

        if len(digits) == 0:
            return result

        def recursion(tmp, index):
            if index == len(digits):
                result.append(tmp)
                return
            
            letters = digitsdict[digits[index]]

            for i in letters:
                recursion(tmp + i, index + 1)
            
        recursion('', 0)
        return result
```
##  comparing with the code given by others, I find that Recursion increases implementation time and will also increases memory.
## buy replacing the dict with list can decrease time.
