# I use two FOR LOOP to complete this task
# There are several things needed to be remembered
## the first one: in python, the form of DICT is "DICT = {'a': ['1', '2', '3'], 'b': ['4', '5', '6']}". It should be Colon but not Equal sign.
## the second one: "output = []" is important, because I need to refresh output so as to avoid that the output become a list likes 
"["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf","adg","adh","adi","aeg","aeh","aei","afg","afh","afi","bdg","bdh","bdi","beg","beh","bei","bfg","bfh","bfi","cdg","cdh","cdi","ceg","ceh","cei","cfg","cfh","cfi"]
"
```
  strings.pop(0)
  strings[0] = output
  output = []
```
# I think that I can also use Recursion to complete this task more efficiently and use less memory.
